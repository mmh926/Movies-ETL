# Movies-ETL README

 
 Deliver, in writing, an ETL function to read three different files. All three of these datasets were converted to DataFrames and properly formatted and displayed. Utilize the data extraction process so that all TV shows are filtered out, extracted, and the cleaned data type then converted into a DataFrame and displayed results. I also used a try-except block.

 With respect to the Kaggle dataset, I cleaned the data and merged datasets. The “movies” DataFrame was created and four tasks were performed and qhile  three tasks were completed during the extraction/transformation of the MovieLens rating data. 

 Finally, I successfully created the movie database, while simultaneously dropping the ratings table, and moved the MovieLens rating to the SQL ratings table.
